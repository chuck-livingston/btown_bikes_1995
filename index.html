<p>On a beautiful weekday afternoon last fall, when commuter traffic was heavy, I stood at the intersection of Seventh Street and Walnut and counted 140 cars before bicyclist rode by.  Given this, I was surprised in December when City Council members described the $3.2 million 7-Line bike lane project as "wildly successful."  It turned out that the baseline count that showed a tripling of bicycle traffic consisted of a pair of two-hour counts on subfreezing days in January with snow predicted.  A more reliable count, taken across from Dunn Meadow on Seventh near Park, revealed bike ridership in the range of 1% of car ridership on College/Walnut.

<p>Before the city poured tens of millions of dollars into bicycle infrastructure and before it won national recognition as a "Gold-level Bicycle Friendly Community," Bloomington was something far different from what it is today: a city in which people rode bicycles.  In 1995, a colleague of mine took photographs around Rawles Hall on the IU Campus.  Most people now living in Bloomington have never witnessed the IU campus  so crammed with bicycles, with every bit of spare space used as an impromptu bike rake.   These pictures are all the more striking when you consider that the IU student population has increased 40% since 1995.    

<p>The explanation for why biking disappeared is multifaceted.  What we know for sure is that the City's answer will be more of the same.  There is little hope for change  in a culture in which public figures are unabashed about whining that stop signs completely destroy the value of bike lanes or that the "hill on Seventh Street" is a major hinderance.  Surely the students in the photographs below would have been befuddled by such bellyaching. 

<p> Next it will be the Lower Cascades Road.  Thirty years ago, bike riders thought it was a lovely  place for a weekend ride.  Today, we hear the incessant demand that it be closed to cars.  We know with certainty that doing so will do absolutely nothing to engender a new generation of bike commuters and the impact of the change on climate change will be nil. Yet what was once an expression, "share the road," has  become the  demand that     drivers who, for various reasons, feel unsafe with alternative routes be excluded.
